# Dependency Injection for C++ (cppdi)

Dependency Injection is a useful testing / decoupling mechanism in other languages / platforms.
cppdi is a small header-only dependency injection module

## Usage:

``` C++

#include "cppdj/cppdj.hpp"

struct foo
{
		void do_something();
}

struct bar
{
		cppdj::dep<foo> m_foo; //Automatically injected on construction

		void do_other_thing()
		{
				m_foo->do_something();
		}
}

void main()
{
		//Register foo and bar (in order)
		//Note: doesn't currently support constructor arg forwarding
		cppdj::register_dep<foo>();
		cppdj::register_dep<bar>();

		//Get a bar
		cppdj::dep<bar> the_bar;
		the_bar->do_other_thing(); //Will call the foo do_something()
}

```
